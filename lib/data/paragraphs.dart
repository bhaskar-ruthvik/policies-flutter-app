  "India has enacted specific laws to combat human trafficking and protect victims. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (ITPA) is the premier legislation for the prevention of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. In 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was passed, which further strengthened the legal provisions against trafficking, including increased penalties for offenders. The government has also drafted the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care, and Rehabilitation) Bill, which aims to further strengthen the legal framework for the protection of trafficking victims.",
  "The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) in India runs several schemes aimed at the protection and rehabilitation of trafficking victims. The Ujjawala scheme is a comprehensive scheme for the prevention of trafficking and rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration, and repatriation of victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The Swadhar Greh scheme provides shelter, food, clothing, and care to the marginalized women/girls who are in need.",
  "The government has established Anti-Human Trafficking Units across various states to enforce anti-trafficking laws and conduct rescue operations to save victims from trafficking situations. These units work in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders.",
  "Numerous NGOs in India work tirelessly to support trafficked women. These organizations offer a range of services including rescue operations, legal aid, psychological counseling, skill development, and vocational training to help survivors rebuild their lives. Notable NGOs in this field include Prajwala, Rescue Foundation, and Shakti Vahini, among others.",
  "The government and various NGOs operate helplines and crisis centers for trafficking victims. These services provide emergency support, guidance, and information on accessing shelter homes and legal assistance.",
  "While these measures represent significant steps towards supporting trafficked women in India, challenges remain in terms of implementation, coordination among various stakeholders, and ensuring that survivors receive timely and effective assistance. Continuous efforts are needed to strengthen the support systems for trafficked women in India."
